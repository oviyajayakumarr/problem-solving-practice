This repository contains Java programs for common string-based problem-solving. It is suitable for students and beginners preparing for coding interviews or improving their Java fundamentals.

Project Structure

- `src/Problem_solving_String/` contains all Java files.
- Each file solves a specific string problem.

📌 List of Problems Solved

- AnagramCheck.java – Check if two strings are anagrams
- BalancedBrackets.java – Check for balanced brackets
- CharOccurrences.java – Count character frequency
- IsDigitOnly.java – Check if a string contains only digits
-  IsomorphicStrings.java – Check if two strings are isomorphic
- LongestCommonPrefix.java – Find longest common prefix
